# .NET API for MaxMind minFraud Score, Insights, and Factors #

## Beta Note ##

This is a beta release. The API may change before the first production
release.

You may find information on the changes in minFraud Score, Insights, and
Factors in our [What's New
documentation](https://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/whats-new-in-minfraud-score-and-minfraud-insights/).

## Description ##

This package provides an API for the [MaxMind minFraud Score, Insights, and
Factors web services](http://dev.maxmind.com/minfraud/minfraud-score-and-insights-api-documentation/).

## Requirements ##

This library works with .NET Framework version 4.5 and above. If you are
using Mono, version 4 or greater is required.

This library depends on [GeoIP2](http://www.nuget.org/packages/MaxMind.GeoIP2/)
and its dependencies.

## Installation ##

### NuGet ###

We recommend installing this library with NuGet. To do this, type the
following into the Visual Studio Package Manager Console:

```
install-package MaxMind.MinFraud
```

## Usage ##

This API uses the [async/await
feature](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh191443.aspx) introduced in
.NET 4.5 to provide non-blocking calls to the minFraud web services.

To use this API, first create a new `WebServiceClient` object. The constructor
takes your MaxMind user ID, license key, and an optional options array as
arguments:

```csharp
var client = new WebServiceClient(10, 'LICENSEKEY');
```

This object should be disposed of when you done using it.

Then create a new `Transaction` object. This represents the transaction that
you are sending to minFraud:

```csharp
var transaction = new Transaction(
    device: new Device(System.Net.IPAddress.Parse("81.2.69.160"),
        userAgent:
            "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64)",
        acceptLanguage: "en-US,en;q=0.8"
        ),
    account:
        new Account(
            userId: "3132",
            username: "fred"
            )
    );
```


After creating the request object, send a non-blocking minFraud Score request
by calling the `ScoreAsync` method using the `await` keyword from a method
marked as async:

```csharp
var score = await client.ScoreAsync(transaction);
```

A minFraud Insights request by calling `InsightsAsync` method:

```csharp
var insights = await client.InsightsAsync(transaction);
```

Or a minFraud Insights request by calling `FactorsAsync` method:

```csharp
var factors = await client.FactorsAsync(transaction);
```

If the request succeeds, a model object will be returned for the endpoint. If
the request fails, an exception will be thrown.

See the API documentation for more details.

### Exceptions ###

Thrown by the request models:

* `ArgumentException` - Thrown when invalid data is passed to the model
  constructor.

Thrown by `ScoreAsync(transaction)` or `InsightsAsync(transaction)` on
`WebServiceClient`:

* `AuthenticationException` - Thrown when the server is unable to authenticate
  the request, e.g., if the license key or user ID is invalid.
* `InsufficientFundsException` - Thrown when your account is out of funds.
* `PermissionRequireException` - Thrown when your account does not have
  permission to access the service.
* `InvalidRequestException` - Thrown when the server rejects the request for
  another reason such as invalid JSON in the POST.
* `MinFraudException` - Thrown when the server returns an unexpected response.
  This also serves as the base class for the above exceptions.
* `HttpException` - Thrown when an unexpected HTTP error occurs such as an
  internal server error or other unexpected status code.
