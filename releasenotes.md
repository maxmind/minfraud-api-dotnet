* Added  `GooglePay`, `Placetopay`, and `ShopifyPayments` to the
  `PaymentProcessor` enum.
* Added `IWebServiceClient` to facilitate mocking of `WebServiceClient`.
  Pull request by Ian GÃ¶bl. GitHub #152.

  property on `MaxMind.GeoIP2.Model.Traits`. This is `true` if the IP address
  belongs to an [anycast network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast).
  This is available in minFraud Insights and Factors.

4.1.0 (2022-03-28)
------------------

* Added the `Country` property to `MaxMind.MinFraud.Request.CreditCard`.
  This is the country where the issuer of the card is located. This may be
  passed instead of `IssuerIdNumber` if you do not wish to pass partial
  account numbers or if your payment processor does not provide them.

4.0.0 (2022-02-07)
------------------

* This library no longer targets .NET 4.6.1.
* .NET 6.0 was added as a target.

  * The class `MaxMind.MinFraud.Response.GeoIP2Country` was removed. This was
    a subclass of `MaxMind.GeoIP2.Model.Country` that added an `IsHighRisk`
    property. This property was marked obsolete in 2019. Now
    `MaxMind.GeoIP2.Model.Country` is used directly.
  * In `MaxMind.MinFraud.Response.Subscores`, the properties `EmailTenure`
    and `IPTenure` were removed. These were deprecated in the web service
    and always return a fixed value.

3.3.0 (2022-01-27)
------------------

* Upgraded `MaxMind.GeoIP2` to 4.1.0. This adds mobile country code (MCC)
  and mobile network code (MNC) to minFraud Insights and Factors responses.
  These are available at `response.IPAddress.Traits.MobileCountryCode` and
  `response.IPAddress.Traits.MobileNetworkCode`. We expect this data to be
  available by late January 2022.
* Added the following new values to the `PaymentProcessor` enum:
  * `Boacompra`
  * `Boku`
  * `Coregateway`
  * `Fiserv`
  * `Neopay`
  * `Neosurf`
  * `Openbucks`
  * `Paysera`

  `MaxMind.MinFraud.Request.CreditCard` have been deprecated in favor of
  `lastDigits` / `LastDigits` respectively and will be removed in a future
  release. `lastDigits` / `LastDigits` also now supports two digit values in
  addition to the previous four digit values.
* Eight digit `MaxMind.MinFraud.Request.CreditCard.issuerIdNumber` inputs are
  now supported in addition to the previously accepted six digit `issuerIdNumber`.
  In most cases, you should send the last four digits for
  `MaxMind.MinFraud.Request.CreditCard.lastDigits`. If you send a `issuerIdNumber`
  that contains an eight digit IIN, and if the credit card brand is not one of the
  following, you should send the last two digits for `lastDigits`:
  * `Discover`
  * `JCB`

  `MaxMind.MinFraud.Response.Disposition`, and is the label of the custom rule
  that was triggered by the transaction.
* Added support for the `/credit_card/was_3d_secure_successful` input in Score,
  Insights and Factors. This input should indicate whether or not the outcome
  of 3-D Secure verification (e.g. Safekey, SecureCode, Verified by Visa) was
  successful. `true` if customer verification was successful, or `false` if
  the customer failed verification. If 3-D Secure verification was not used, was
  unavailable, or resulted in another outcome other than success or failure, do
  not include this field.

3.1.0 (2021-02-02)
------------------

* Added `ApplePay` and `ApsPayments` to the `PaymentProcessor` enum.
* Added additional normalizing of the request email address in
  `MaxMind.MinFraud.Request.Email` when `hashAddress` is set to `true`.

1.5.0 (2017-11-01)

* Behavior change: When sending an email address to MaxMind, this library now
  defaults to sending the plain text email address rather than its MD5 hash.
  Previously only the MD5 hash of the email address would be sent and sending
  the plain text email address was not possible. If you wish to send only the
  MD5 hash of the email address, you must now set the `hashAddress` constructor
  parameter to `true` on `MaxMind.MinFraud.Request.Email`.
* Previously, it was possible to get an `IndexOutOfRangeException` when calling

  Insights anonymizer fields.
